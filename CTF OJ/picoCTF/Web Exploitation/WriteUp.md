### Web Exploitation

##### GET aHEAD

We can easily find when we use GET method,the background would be red but blue by POST. According to hint

> Maybe you have more than 2 choices

Maybe the choices coordinate with REQUEST method.According to the title,we try to repeat the request using HEAD method.Hence,we find the solution.

You can utilize the tools like curl or burpsuite to carry out this case.

```shell
curl -I -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/index.php
```

##### Cookies

Certainly we should edit cookies to get right answer.We use burpsuite to find out more details.Following the prompt,we input snickerdoodle to search.What sets it apart from other inputs like 1,2,3 is its cookies become 0 from -1 and api /check.We can reasonably speculate that /check is our target page.So we send it to intruder to exploit its cookies like this:

<img src="./assets/cookies1.png" alt="cookies1" style="zoom: 33%;" />
