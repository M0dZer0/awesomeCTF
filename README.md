## About me

CTFer@WEB majoring in cybersecurity in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.My CTF (Capture The Flag) handle is M0dZer0, a moniker that playfully alludes to the mathematical operation of modulo zero. In computing, attempting to perform a modulo operation by zero typically results in an error or an undefined operation, hinting at an action without meaningful outcome. This name symbolizes my fascination and determination in the realm of cybersecurity: to relentlessly hunt down these "meaningless" or erroneous pieces of code that may lead to vulnerabilities. Just as 'modulo zero' is an anomaly within mathematical operations, I strive to uncover and understand the anomalies within software, pushing the boundaries of my technical knowledge and capabilities. Each challenge is an opportunity to grow and each piece of flawed code a stepping stone towards mastery in cybersecurity.

## Areas of interest to me
### Crypto
**Vulnerable RSA Encryption**

### Web

SQL injection
